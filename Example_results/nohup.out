Using an excessive number of cores has a diminishing return! It is recommended not to exceed 8 cores per trimming process (you asked for 8 cores). Please consider re-specifying
Path to Cutadapt set as: 'cutadapt' (default)
Cutadapt seems to be working fine (tested command 'cutadapt --version')
Cutadapt version: 4.1
Could not detect version of Python used by Cutadapt from the first line of Cutadapt (but found this: >>>#!/bin/sh<<<)
Letting the (modified) Cutadapt deal with the Python version instead
pigz 2.6
Parallel gzip (pigz) detected. Proceeding with multicore (de)compression using 8 cores

No quality encoding type selected. Assuming that the data provided uses Sanger encoded Phred scores (default)

AUTO-DETECTING ADAPTER TYPE
===========================
Attempting to auto-detect adapter type from the first 1 million sequences of the first file (>> /mnt/users/bohan/scripts/Github/Example/fastqs/example_RNA.R1.fastq.gz <<)

Found perfect matches for the following adapter sequences:
Adapter type	Count	Sequence	Sequences analysed	Percentage
Nextera	27	CTGTCTCTTATA	10443	0.26
smallRNA	0	TGGAATTCTCGG	10443	0.00
Illumina	0	AGATCGGAAGAGC	10443	0.00
Using Nextera adapter for trimming (count: 27). Second best hit was smallRNA (count: 0)

AUTO-DETECTING ADAPTER TYPE
===========================
Attempting to auto-detect adapter type from the first 1 million sequences of the first file (>> /mnt/users/bohan/scripts/Github/Example/example_DNA/example_DNA.R1.fastq.gz <<)

Found perfect matches for the following adapter sequences:
Adapter type	Count	Sequence	Sequences analysed	Percentage
Nextera	11465	CTGTCTCTTATA	17059	67.21
Illumina	0	AGATCGGAAGAGC	17059	0.00
smallRNA	0	TGGAATTCTCGG	17059	0.00
Using Nextera adapter for trimming (count: 11465). Second best hit was Illumina (count: 0)
